Range-V3-VS2015

[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Range-V3-VS2015.svg)](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Range-V3-VS2015.svg)  

This is a fork of [Eric Niebler's range-v3 library](https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3) with extensive (and somewhat invasive) workarounds to support the Visual C++ compiler as released in Microsoft Visual Studio 2015. Our intent is to evolve both this fork and upstream range-v3 toward each other by upstreaming less invasive workarounds and removing those that become unnecessary as the compiler evolves to be more standard conformant. Eventually [the two streams will merge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyaLZHiJJnE) and Visual C++ users will be well-served by unmodified upstream range-v3. This fork will then exist only to provide support for users of older less-conforming versions of Visual C++.

About (excerpted from [the upstream README](https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3/blob/master/README.md)):
------

Why does C++ need another range library? Simply put, the existing solutions haven't kept up with the rapid evolution of C++. Range v3 is a library for the future C++. Not only does it work well with today's C++ -- move semantics, lambdas, automatically deduced types and all -- it also anticipates tomorrow's C++ with Concepts Lite.

Range v3 forms the basis of a proposal to add range support to the standard library ([N4128: Ranges for the Standard Library](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4128.html)). It also will be the reference implementation for an upcoming Technical Specification. These are the first steps toward turning ranges into an international standard.
